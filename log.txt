3/5
- updated project plan according to TA feedback
- added CZ2018 and CZ2022 weather data
- added fire csv data

TODO
- decide on whether to use CZ2018 or CZ2022 weather data
- being processing/cleaning/modeling data

-------------
3/19
- using all weather data from 2014-2025 (fire data mainly begins mid 2013 so round up to 2014)
- wrote and executed scripts for processing fire and weather data

NOTES
- the 'process-weather-data.py' script mimics the 'Daily' sheet of the 'Fin4toExcel.xlsm' file for each FIN4 file per city per year
- ^ doesnt produce the 100% exact same results, but quite close (as far as i can tell), might be due to rounding differences
- started way too late rip
- omega fatty commit

TODO
- filter fire/weather data to only include common cities (natural join on city kinda): should cut down by a lot (hopefully not too much)
- consider week long data entries or similar if still too long (?)
- being model construction

-------------
3/19 (no commit)
- corrected script for processing weather data (includes 12-31), hopefully the exact same as 'Fin4toExcel.xlsm'
- deleted raw data from repo, moved to google drive instead (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1D4q_7aPc9mx8MtHmdEg1-FQKdTX9w-JH?usp=sharing)

NOTES
- 4am coding great idea to put full raw dataset in repo xdd
- class just covered classification, looks to be the main point of this proj

TODO
- further process data (weather LEFT OUTER JOIN fire (?))
- divide into training/testing: determine based off of amount of fire data after join
- think about how to modify readme for midterm report
- model with tsne, more stuff (tbd)
- implement classification

-------------
3/20
- corrected fire script to omit fires with 0 acres burned
- corrected weather script to add double digit days/months when applicable
- created dbs to run SQL
- created combined, training, validation, and testing data
- ^ REMOVE ALL 2025 DATA FROM TESTING, UPDATE EVERYTHING ACCORDINGLY (look at NOTES + TODO)

NOTES
- initial panic bc LEFT OUTER JOIN only produced 14 rows
- ^ bc weather used single digit months/days, fire always uses double; fixed
- data split is approx 70/15/15: training = 2014-2020 (186 fires); validation = 2021-2023 (37 fires); testing = 2024-2025 (38 fires)
- likely/might have to filter validation and testing data to only include cities in testing data!
- FAKE 2025 DATA: FIX URGENTLY (just wanna get this commit in)

TODO
- URGENT: JUST NOTICED THERES FAKE DATA FOR ALL OF 2025: OMIT ENTIRE YEAR PROBABLY
- LIKELY: ONLY INCLUDE CITIES IN VALIDATION/TESTING THAT EXIST IN TRAINING (UPDATE EVERYTHING ACCORDINGLY, hopefully doesnt fuck everything up too much)
- modeling/visualization
- update README for midterm report
- waiting for lecture/lab to cover prediction portion
