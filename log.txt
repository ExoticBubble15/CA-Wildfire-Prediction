3/5
- updated project plan according to TA feedback
- added CZ2018 and CZ2022 weather data
- added fire csv data

TODO
- decide on whether to use CZ2018 or CZ2022 weather data
- being processing/cleaning/modeling data


3/19
- using all weather data from 2014-2025 (fire data mainly begins mid 2013 so round up to 2014)
- wrote and executed scripts for processing fire and weather data

NOTES
- the 'process-weather-data.py' script mimics the 'Daily' sheet of the 'Fin4toExcel.xlsm' file for each .FIN4 file per city per year
- ^ doesnt produce the 100% exact same results, but quite close (as far as i can tell), might be due to rounding differences
- started way too late rip
- omega fatty commit

TODO
- filter fire/weather data to only include common cities (natural join on city kinda): should cut down by a lot (hopefully not too much)
- consider week long data entries or similar if still too long (?)
- being model construction
